/* Fast(er) table diff

Optimal diffs for tables is NP-Hard so we need to find an approximate
solution that feels "reasonable".

An approximate window-comparison algorithm

Start with two matrices M1 and M2

Keep track of all matches in a bit vector
F = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0...]

1) Find the min row (i) and column (j) parameters of M1 and M2
2) Create all windows of size A = i * j
   a) If maximal match has been found (boundary of no match / match found) in F
      go to 5
   b) If A < 2 then return swap M1 for M2 and return calculated score
   c) If there are no more windows, use "search_down" procedure which
   cuts i,j in two and repeats from 2
3) Create matices H1 and H2 of all hashes of the values in the i*j
window convolved over M1 and M2 (respectively)
4) Search for matches of hash-values in H1 and H2
   a) If there are no matches, return to 2
   b) If there are matches
       i) Record in F at index i*j
       ii) increase A by .5 and repeat 2
5) Cut non-overlaping maximal match(es) from M1 and M2 (choose
arbitrarily from top-left preference)

6) Decompose M1 and M2 into 4 overlaping matrices:

  a) Left
  b) Top
  c) Bottom
  d) Right

7) Return to 1 for each of Left, Top, Bottom, Right

  a) Choose the maximal match from the alternatives starting with
  Left, Top, Bottom and then Right.
  b) Use best match scores to paste back together M1 and M2


M1:
